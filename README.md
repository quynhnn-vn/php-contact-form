# PHP Project: A simple web contact form

This project will create a HTML web form using PHP to validate and sanitize data.

## The form consists of:

- A text input for user’s name
- A text input for user’s email address
- A drop down to select user’s issue (Query, Feedback, Complaint, Other)
- A text area for user’s comment
- The form will post to a second page which will display the information in an easy to read format.
